<h3>Funny Looking</h3>
<p id="author">by Alan Balter</p>

<p data-keywords="Mom">
    At the hospital on the day of my birth<br>
    I&apos;m told I looked strange for what it&apos;s worth<br>
    Doc didn&apos;t whack my rump like he did to others<br>
    Nope, I looked so funny he slapped my mother</p>

<p data-keywords="Mom Dad monkey">
    <br>
    Mom said my face could make onions cry<br>
    Dad took me to the zoo, and a girl made a crack<br>
    &quot;How nice of that man to bring the monkey back&quot;</p>

<p class="blue-paragraph" >
    Once I got sick with the Asian flu<br>
    I needed some medicine like other kids do<br>
    The doctor was hardly a humanitarian<br>
    When he suggested I visit a veterinarian</p>

<p>
    Being quite truthful; indeed brutally frank<br>
    They turn off the camera when I go to a bank<br>
    The first time I visited a psychiatrist&hyphen;Ouch!<br>
    She insisted I lie face down on the couch</p>

<p>
    But, I made it to college and earned a bachelor&apos;s degree<br>
    Then completed a Master&apos;s and Ph.D<br>
    I&apos;m the owner and president of a large company<br>
    Where lots of good looking people work for me</p>

<p>
    So if you don&apos;t like the image you see in your mirror<br>
    Here&apos;s a message that couldn&apos;t be any clearer<br>
    Don&apos;t worry young people; just hit the books<br>
    &apos;Cause what you know gets you further than how you look</p>
