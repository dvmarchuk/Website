            You play as Eagle Max Power, elite special trooper from MarzSec, a secret unit of the US Army.
            While on patrol around the Martian wasteland a portal opened in the middle of your base. Tyroids
            and Flynoids from the planet Schrogun 6 invaded from the portal and took over your base. King
            Ralphie has taken Commander McG hostage in the bridge and are wiping out all life on mars. Are
            you a bad enough dude to rescue McG?
