            You saved McG! He was able to craft a dark matter disruptor using spare parts around the base.
            With this disruptor you were able to close the portal and send a chain reaction to their base and
            destroy their portal creating capabilities, preventing future invasions. The survivors on base
            were able to fully repair all major systems, but could not fix the coffee machine. With your
            actions you single handed saved human settlement on mars for future generations.
