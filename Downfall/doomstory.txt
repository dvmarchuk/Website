New game
Hello Eagle Max Power, elite special trooper from MarzSec, a secret unit of the US Army.
While I was on patrol around the Martian wasteland a portal opened in the middle of your base. Tyroids
and Flynoids from the planet Schrogun 6 invaded from the portal and took over your base. King
Ralphie has taken Commander McG hostage in the bridge and the enemies wiping out all life on mars. Are
you a bad enough dude to rescue rescue McG?

Level 1:The Beginning
You've arrived at a Martian wasteland. You see a portal that might lead you to your objective and possible death. There's nothing else around, what will you do?

Level 2:The Maze
You made it! Alive in one piece. You see two routes you can take in this close space. You have a bad feeling about this place and you can hear some organisms walking about. You'll have to reach the end of this place in order to find the missing civilian. 

Level 3:The Boss
Finally, you see a cage with McG inside of it. The only thing that stands before you and him is the boss alien. Don't die, and best of luck!


End game
You saved McG! He was able to craft a dark matter disruptor using spare parts around the base.
With this disruptor you were able to close the portal and send a chain reaction to their base and
destroy their portal creating capabilities, preventing future invasions. The survivors on base
were able to fully repair all major systems, but could not fix the coffee machine. With your
actions you singlle handedly saved human settlement on mars for future generations.
